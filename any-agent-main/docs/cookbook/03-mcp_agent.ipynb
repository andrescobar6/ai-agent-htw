    "# Creating an agent with MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) (MCP) introduced by Anthropic has proven to be a popular method for providing an AI agent with access to a variety of tools. [This Huggingface blog post ](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp) has a nice explanation of MCP.  In this tutorial, we'll build an agent that is able to leverage MCP server provided tools.\n",

    "We support a variety of underlying agent frameworks (OpenAI, Smolagents, Langchain, TinyAgent, etc), which all have their own particular agentic AI implementations. For this tutorial's simple use case, any of the frameworks should work just fine, but any-agent makes it easy to try out a different framework later, if we so choose. For this example, we will use the [TinyAgent](frameworks/tinyagent.md) framework.  \n",

    "### Pick an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of which agent framework you choose, each framework supports LiteLLM, which is a proxy that allows us to use whichever LLM inside the framework, hosted on by any provider. For example, we could use a local model via llama.cpp or llamafile, a google hosted gemini model, or a AWS bedrock hosted Llama model. For this example, let's use Mistral AI's mistral/mistral-small-latest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pick which tools to use\n",
    "\n",
    " In this example, we'll add a few MCP servers that we host locally, which means we'll use a Stdio MCP server. If an MCP Server is already running and hosted elsewhere, you can use an SSE connection to access it. You can browse some of the officially supported MCP servers [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).\n",
    "\n",
    " Lets give use two MCP servers: \n",
    " \n",
